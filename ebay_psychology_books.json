            "Oh yes, psychopathy/sociopathy is thriving in the USA.  Deja vu, the soulless yuppies depicted in this book have lately been overrun by rebel flag waving rednecks, but whether 1% or not, the general mood is the same - sneer at the homeless, worship Trump, and spend outrageous amounts of money in order to feel good about yourself.  Seeing as people routinely get away with murder (and worse crimes against humanity) these days, it doesn't seem that much is changed.  The dreary obsessive descriptions of what everybody is wearing gets really old, but if we mentally replace that with an obsession with technology and what brand gadget everyone is holding, its a pretty seamless transition between then and now - we definitely value stuff over people.",
            "The novel itself feels too long and while it is well written, I at most found it entertaining, it never felt like a dark comedy or even gallows humor. When it is dark, it's just that. I find it far too sinister to be funny. The parts that could be funny are repeated so much that they become tedious. But the way Ellis writes makes up for this, greatly. I don't feel as if Patrick Bateman becomes and interesting character until serious mental cracks begin to show. But, all in all, the novel's ending is far better than it's beginning, however lacking the humor may be.",

Just remember not to visit him at his swank, postmodernist condo."

            "Very good read. In this book, author Bessel van der Kolk, M.D. contends that many psychiatric patients are misdiagnosed, largely because those who determine the content of the DSM have chosen not to include a Developmental Trauma Disorder diagnosis. Without the clinician's option to diagnose Developmental Trauma Disorder, patients may be misdiagnosed as having ADHD, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and many other anxiety-related labels, he says. He explains that a more accurate  diagnosis could lead to more practical treatment. Citing numerous research studies, van der Kolk establishes a connection between mind and body and relates said connection to trauma at various stages of life -- from childhood abuse and neglect to war-related PTSD. Part of the joy of the read is van der Kolk's fairness in granting that some treatments such as eye movement desensitization reprocessing (EMDR) aren't yet fully understood even though they seem to be beneficial to many patients. Another part of the joy of the read is that the narratives and case studies sprinkled throughout the text keep the action flowing in a sea of statistical evidence. I'd recommend this book to clinicians, teachers, doctors, nurses, policemen, firemen, war veterans, parents, grandparents, and almost everyone else as I suspect we all either deal with our own trauma or know people who, as a result of their trauma, create chaos in others' lives. This book is enlightening and promotes hope for those who have experienced trauma.Read full review",
            "This book had fascinating illustrations of how trauma affects a person not only psychologically, but physically.  It makes you understand why some people are the way they are---anti-social personalities, people with anger management issues, etc.  It also gives some compelling evidence of unconventional therapy techniques that have shown great promise but discusses how our society seems to prefer lifelong treatment of a problem with drugs rather than treating the underlying cause and freeing a person from the burden of trauma that they carry with them throughout their lives.  The author is a psychiatrist who specializes in treating trauma patients from early childhood through adulthood.  Fascinating!",
            "I have PTSD and have been in therapy for 16 years.  This book is a must read for sufferers and help providers alike.  It is written by an extremely well qualified  research scientist with many years of treating and research.  The case studies are very interesting.  He provides information from the medical and clinical viewpoint.  The information on treatments and medications are very interesting.  As a patient I find the history of treatment and discoveries of great interest as I have seen the developments from the patient side.",
            "This is a really great book that explains how trauma damages people. The brain doesn't heal from trauma unless it's \"taught\" to (this isn't in the book, it's my own opinion after 25 years of being a therapist.\" This is a great book that's eye opening and healing for many who have experienced any form of trauma. Some reactions are trauma based and some are psychiatric. There is a difference.",
            "Finally, here is writing about the history of the PTSD diagnosis and how it came to be.  And the compassion and caring that these psychiatrists and therapists and researchers express for their patients/clients is very touching.  To me, it's as good a book as \"The Road Less Traveled\" by M. Scott Peck, MD.  Easy to read, lots of case histories that actually make sense, and are to the point, and the history of research into causation and the relationship between early childhood trauma, and how the brain adapts in order to \"function\" after it interprets the trauma.  Researchers are actually developing standards for measuring what used to be thought of as \"immeasurable\".  As an accountant and financial analyst, it's the kind of stuff I LOVE!"

Rather, he was a perfectionist and at the same time, a pleasant man who was thoroughly comfortable in his own skin, He was extremely curious about EVERYTHING. His discoveries were numerous. I highly recommend this book.",

If you are \"stuck\" in your life, there's an alchemy in the reading of this book that will move you to the inmost core of your being.\nAlthough not technically a book for the newbie to psychology, Jung's clarity of expression, along with an excellent little dictionary of unfamiliar terminology, make this book accessible to most anyone who has the patience to read it carefully. That patience will be rewarded with  deep and stirring information regarding what it means to be fully human.\nAlthough a few concepts are dated, Jung was amply apologetic as to his humanity and possible errors of judgement. This ultimately makes the material still as poignant and valuable as it was at the time it was written, and maybe even more so in the pervasive atmosphere of anomie humanity faces today.Read full review",
            "Carl Jung is one of the most lucid, imaginative and far-seeing minds of the millenia, and this book is a glimpse into the back rooms of that amazing thought process. What was he really like as a child?  What did he think about?  How did those early experiences form the man who had such a profound impact on the field of psychology?  The reassuring part of this biography is how readable it is, especially the first three chapters, which were written by Jung himself.  This is a volume I will return to again and again, and should be required reading for everyone who seeks to understand the extraordinary journey of the questioning mind.",

Seemed like a steal until i got it. if i were selling this book i would label it as FAIR condition. it was a hardcover, and the book jacket was stained and disgusting looking, along with the spine showing the pages, as if someone spilt something on it. like i said, i knew the book was used & i expected some minor wear & tear, but i dont think it should have been considered VERY GOOD condition when it was clearly only FAIR.

            "I've heard several reviews of the book and wasn't compelled to read it until I learned how the book/story came to be. The author's candid details of what is considered by most to be one of life's 'peripheral' relationships, comes full-circle and gives the reader a strong 'curtain-call' message, long before intermission. It touches on every emotion at some point and will have you making comparisons to your own life, by the end of the first 'Tuesday'. We tend not to notice certain important things in life which don't yet 'apply' to us but in the end, this story applies to everyone and to read it earlier rather than later, is a gift. Death is certain for all of us and as a frightening thought for most, we simply do our best to pretend it's not out there. In my opinion, this book is an answer to the \"What if...\". If you don't feel anything by the end of the second 'Tuesday', you may be numb. I strongly recommend you re-read, and finish the book.

THEN, I came across this book \" Tuesdays with Morrie \" and it answered everything about life, love, family, getting older, self esteem, and with loving and holding on to respecting yourself all through everything in what life gives you in the ups and downs . Mitch Albom, the Author, says it in such an excellant way from what Morrie has told him and how Morrie has felt it in his own life. This book will bring you up if you are down and this book will help you understand life and yourself and people . I LOVE this book. This is my FAVORITE ! I even have it signed by the Author himself .

            "This novel used to be part of the Theology curriculum at my school but as an English teacher, somehow it ended up in my course of study.  I highly recommend that this be read at the high school or college level.  Frankl's position is that man does not seek pleasure above all else as Freud believed, or power, as Adler believed, but meaning.  Life needs to hold a purpose.  When life lacks meaning, and people find themselves without meaningful relationships or goals, they may experience what Frankl refers to as the \"existential vacuum\" -- a condition that he applies to excessive drug use and suicide.  \r\n\r\nThis novel, following Frankl's experiences in a concentration camp, was originally written in 1959, but definately applies to our world today. Frankl's \"meaning\" in the camp essentially became the creation of this novel.  The importance of Frankl surviving, and eventually writing this book is what provided his meaning.  While in the camps, however, Frankl also studied the resilience or despair of his campmates, analyzing why some survive and others give up.  The book provides a fascinating study of the human body and mind's ability to withstand extreme conditions.  Personally, it provided me with a strong sense of security, assurance, and hope in the event that I find myself in such severe conditions; however, the tenets of \"logotherapy\" which Frankl discusses in more detail toward the end of the book, are ideas that I find myself returning to and applying to everyday stressors as well.  \r\n\r\nAlthough many of my high school students found some of Frankl's ideas and terminology a bit difficult, most have confirmed that this novel was the most significantly valuable part of the course I taught.Read full review",

A triumph of the human spirit! Dr. Viktor Frankl's message may be critically important to many of us in the future, should any of us have to face trauma and brutality at the hands of others. A tool for healing and regeneration of the spirit. There are bad people in the world, or good people acting badly. But humanity redeems itself in the lives and actions of people like Frankl. My favorite part of this book is where Frankl is interviewing a dying woman, and she tells him that she is having a dialogue with the tree, outside the window. Thinking that she is delusional, he asked her what the tree is saying. She responds:\"I am life, everlasting. I am here, I am with you\" (paraphrased).

            "In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell offers his account of humanity's seemingly instantaneous judgment in critical situations.  The book features a series of fascinating anecdotal case studies, skilled interweavings of psychological experiments, explanations, and unexpected connections which have become part of Gladwell's writing style since Tipping Point.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of Blink, he illustrates how incredibly complex decisions are often made in the matter of seconds: experts on Greek art, who had no vested interest in judging a rare 6th-century sculpture of a youth as authentic, sensed immediately that it was fake.  But Gladwell points out that if expertise, or mere accumulated experiences sufficed, humans could unerringly trust these decisions made as rapidly as the blink of an eye, but, as he illustrates through several counterpuntal stories, such blinks can also be deceptive.   It should be noted that he seems to stretch some of his examples to conform to his blink-of-an-eye theory. \r\n\r\nGladwell is an impressive synthesizer and is, in that sense, a model for both teachers and students.  Because of his skills as a journalist, the book is accurate and informative -- complete with numerous anecdotes.  Blink is a satisfying and informative read, but not as scholarly as some might have you believe.Read full review",
            "I found this book to be very interesting and one of those books that you don't want to put down. Malcolm Gladwell introduces us to a thinking technique he calls \"thin slicing\", which allows us to make decisions very quickly. As he describes it, thin slicing is the ability or method of paying attention to just a few, key factors, versus weighting multiple variables when making a decision. This is not a how-to book but rather a collection of stories and examples Gladwell has organized that demonstrate thin slicing and it's bets and worst.\r\n\r\nThe stories and examples are fun to read and thought provoking. I found myself analyzing my thinking while reading several of the stories. My only disappointment with the book, and the reason I rated it good instead of excellent is that it doesn't provide any how-to. The examples are great but it would be nice to provide one chapter at the end with tips, exercises, or something that will help you learn to \"thin slice\".Read full review",
            "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\n\nThe Entertainment Critic Book Review By James Myers\nBLINK: THE POWER OF THINKING WITHOUT THINKING-By Malcolm Gladwell\nPublished by Back Bay Books,\nLittle, Brown and Company, and\nHachette Book Group USA\n296 Pages\nISBN:  978-0-316-01066-5(Pb)\n(Four Star Rating)****\n\n\n\u201cI think we are innately suspicious of \u2026 rapid cognition.  We live in a world that assumes that the quality of a decision is directly related to the time and effort that went into making it.  When doctors are faced with a difficult diagnosis, they order more tests, and when we are uncertain about what we hear, we ask for a second opinion.  And what do we tell our children?  Haste makes waste.  Look before you leap.  Stop and think.  Don\u2019t judge a book by its cover.  We believe thatwe are always better off gathering as much information as possible and spending as much time as possible in deliberation.  We really only trust conscious decision making.  But there are moments, particularly in times of stress, when haste does not make waste, when our snap judgments and first impressions can offer a much better means of making sense of the world.  The first task of Blink is to convince you of a simple fact; decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.\u201d\n\n\nBlink is a brilliant, new and insightful book written by Malcolm Gladwell, staff writer for the New Yorker, former business and science reporter at the Washington Post, and author of another #1 best seller, The Tipping Point.  The premise of Blink is that rapid cognition thought that occurs in the blink of any eye, are powerful and important conclusions that we come to, that should not be ignored, but embraced.  In other words, under some circumstances we can trust our snap judgments, better than we can trust more deliberate, conscious, balanced thought.  Mr. Gladwell teaches us that sometimes when we are under stress and pressure, our snap judgments serve us better that more conscious, analyzed thought.  Human beings have what Gladwell refers to as \u201cthe power of thin slicing\u201d which means that human beings have the ability to make sense of situations based upon the thinnest slice of experience.\n\nBlink is also a study of when our instincts betray us and why.  For example the Getty museum purchased a statute that was supposedly constructed in ancient Greece.  They studied it for 14 months with scientific tests and complicated chemical analysis and came to the conclusion that it was authentic.  A few experts that constantly evaluated objects of antiquity glanced at it and based on their experience without performing tests, felt that it was fake.  Getty purchased the statute for $10 Million Dollars.  After many years and much study, Getty finally came to the conclusion that the experts, who just glanced at the statute and sensed that something was off, were right.  The statute was a phony.  The scientists with their machines were wrong, the art experts with their hunches and experience were right.  Gladwell teaches us that our unconscious may be a powerful force, but it is not infallible.  Certain variables can cause our rapid cognition to go awry, and what we need to do is identify those and understand them.  We can learn when to listen to our snap judgments and when we should not.\n\nGladwell demonstrates in the book that our snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.  We can actualRead full review",
            "You don\u2019t need to read this review.  You\u2019ve already made up your mind about the book Blink.  You\u2019ve received enough inputs from sources that you trust or don\u2019t trust that your subconscious has already decided whether or not Blink is a good book.  If this review agrees with your subconscious, you\u2019ll agree with the review.  If this review disagrees with your subconscious, you will attribute my opinions on this book to my incompetence.  Why and how did you come to make such a hasty judgement on this book ?  \u201cBlink\u201d seeks to answer those questions.\r\n\r\nIn this latest book, Gladwell (of \u201cTipping Point\u201d fame) explores \u201cthin slicing\u201d, the theory that we only need a tiny bit of information or exposure to something to make a decision.  The genius of Gladwell is that he examines how common people usethin slicing, usually unaware of the fact that they are thin slicing, and that he also examines subject matter experts using thin slicing to practice their chosen art with remarkable accuracy.  Some examples of common people unknowingly thin slicing include speed daters who make remarkably sound choices about dating partners and police officers who, in \u201cMatrix\u201d like fashion, slow down time in the heat of a gunfight to make amazing decisions.  Great examples of experts who practice thin slicing include the ability of a marriage counselor to determine whether a marriage will succeed or fail with 95% accuracy\u2026.based on 30 seconds of conversation between spouses.\r\n \r\nIt\u2019s a fascinating book that has the potential to change the way you think about your own thoughts and interpret the actions and reactions of those you interact with.Read full review",
            "This is a typical Malcolm Gladwell book - a good, coherent, layman explanation of the research carried out in the functioning of our brain. In brief, we make conscious well-thought out decisions and unconscious, rapid decisions. The book talks about the power of the latter (and hence the title \"blink\") through several examples. The content is great and the writing is easy to follow. I would strongly recommend this book."

            "I had actually read this book, much more than once! Every time I purchase it, I read it, and I recommend it to a friend or a family member. I let them borrow it, and I never see the book again.... So what do I do? I keep buying new copies.\n\nThe best way, to summarize and review this piece of literature is to simply say, THIS BOOK CHANGED MY LIFE. In so many ways, and much more then I can actually sum up in 5000 words, but I will try... It made me reaffirm my belief in GOD, it made me realize that you must stay true to yourself no matter what, and it made me learn that life is worth living, and to never give up on your dreams... It also thought me and reaffirmed, yet again, that things are meant to happen and they happen for a reason. But above all that, Love is all, and in the end it willall work out the way it should have to begin with.\n\nThe book will not be the great big piece of literature of the century by the way its written, and I don't think that's the intention here. It is about a journey, and the message it caries. I almost guarantee, that you will be able to find something in this work that speaks to you and I truly believe a little bit of \"....what da' f****?\" reaction will be coming from you as you read. Its short and I've read it in one sitting no problem. You will want to follow this read with \"Only Love Is Real\" once you are finished.....Read full review",
            "In reading this book one need's only to have an open mind as the author now does despite his scientific root's. We know not the wonder's life has after we leave this life. A close family member has had the same experiences as the patient in this book and I never doubted his sincerity to his event's. This book was suggested to me by my 30 year old daughter, raised in a Christian home, but never fully accepting the Christian life, only to go out in the world thinking there is a higher state of being most human's are looking for. So compelling the book is I read it in 2 day's time. Wonderfully written and not boring waiting for a climax at the end. It is what it is! life's experience.",
            "This is a truly inspirational book. Taking into account that it is a true story, I would say it's remarkably impressive. This is the perfect book aimed to turn upside down your beliefs about life and death. It's written by a scientist and the  man behind him, but also by his uncommon patient and a universal wisdom canalized through her (the masters). In my personal case, I should say I have believed in the Rosicrucian theory of reincarnation for quite a while now. When I read certain passages of the book it felt like I was listening to a friend of mine who's a higher-order rosicrucian. However, like Dr. Weiss himself admits, before meeting Catherine he had never read anything related to parapsychology or reincarnation. According to his words, his mind was too analytical and scientific to focus on something he considered to be open to speculation. Even having the proofs before his eyes, he still doubted his own senses for some time. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who seeks enlightment, spiritual peace or just wonders about whats beyond this world. Beware, narrow minds, this book will surely shock you. People interested in reincarnation-related studies, take a look at Dr. Ian Stevenson's work. And remember that the ultimate source of higher knowledge lies nowhere but within ourselves. God bless you all.Read full review",
            "anyone who lost a loved one, or have questions regarding the afterlife, or life in general, this book is great. It contains many points that reflect a true spiritual event. it helps us understand that we are not just this one birth, we are of many lives. This book helps you stick your head a little higher to see the world around you, it is great for someone who is spiritual and wants to know more. Great book, short but very nice to read. We are all filled with mysteries, sometimes we dont know why we fear or like something, maybe its something from a previous birth? Entertaining and vivid, great book and a great author.",
            "I am an open-minded person who recently lost my son. His passing sent me into a deep depression. I have been reading a number of books to help me accept his passing and go on living. This book is at my number one spot for just that purpose.  Written by a doctor with more than excellent credentials, it helped me understand our purpose in life. I could not put this book down. Easy to read, easy to understand. No confusing medical terminology. I just bought two more copies to give to other family memebers. I plan to read the other books written by Dr Weiss. My next one, Messages from the Masters, was also bought on ebay. Absolutely would highly recommend this book!"

I also had an interest in Psychology (which I now have my degree in), so reading about one particular \"malchick's\" experience with reinforcement was extremely interesting. \r\n\r\nThe thing that is the most amazing part about this book is the sheer LUNACY of the language presented. What's even more incredible is that by the end of the book, I assure you that you will begin to actually understand the fake language put forth, and would probably be able to speak it fluently-should you ever find yourself drinking some moloko with your droogs. \r\n\r\nBasically, READ THIS BOOK!

Some parts of the movie based on the book were really pushing the edge as to how sick Alex really is, but if they showed a true portrayal of the real Alex, theres no way they could put it on film, even in today's movie industry.\n\nWhat makes the book so great is that Alex is just a young kid (15 ears old) when it was him and his droogs. But throughout the whole book you get to see the slick and stylish Alex, that also happens to be extremely disturbed. In the book he doesnt brag about the things he does, he makes it out like (and to him it is) a sort of every day thing to rape,molest,murder and steel. He is basically just telling his stories  from the youth perspective that he is. But there is no doubt he is A very disturbing, very sadistic character.\n\nAlso, in this book, it includes the last chapter which was left out in the movie, which is a nice bonus.\n\nIts also fun to see the differences between the book and the movie, but the book takes the cake in my opinion.\n\nJust know there is a lot of old english slang which can be hard for the american reader to fallowRead full review"

I loved it so much I got on Ebay to see if they had a used copy of the paperback for sale. It was at a good price, and I received it sooner than was expected.

            "Most of the novel was involved in describing with rapturous delight the material wonders of life in the NY upper social crust.  The main character was not very interesting, never very well described, and not in the least bit sympathetic.  The dialogue was way too clever and unnatural - everyone had a great quip and a quick comeback.  There was also no \"soul\" there.  While it could have been a contrast between values of the rich and the poor, it was not - the poor were just wanting and the rich just socialized ... except for one who went off to fight in a war.",

In recognition of depressed people possibly needing antidepressant medications, he has an updated guide for consumers on antidepressant drugs which is very useful in learning about possible drug actions and side effects.  I bought this book because it was recommended by a psychologist for working on depression and related problems.  It contains self-tests and scoring for analyzing situations and behaviors that can result in or be caused by distorted thinking,  It also teaches the reader how to recognize distorted thoughts and figure out ways to change that way of thinking to more realistic and positive thoughts.  It is a very good book and Burns writes in an unpretentious and understandable style.  Compared to other self-help books of this nature, it is much more detailed and has very helpful exercises, tables and charts.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to help themselves out of a depressed mood and possibly change behaviors to remain in a better mood without drugs.Read full review",

            "The author, Doris Kerns Goodwin knows her stuff, well resarched book, a great historical story. The best book of 2021 that I really enjoyed! Love it!",
            "Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin (2006)\r\nIn 1860, in Chicago, Illinois, the Republican Party made a historic choice when it selected Abraham Lincoln to be its candidate for the presidency. The choice stunned each of Lincoln's three rival candidates--William Henry Seward of New York; Salmon P. Chase of Ohio; and Edward Bates of Missouri--all of whom were better known nationally and better connected politically--and each of whom thought he himself would win. Even more surprising, but indicative of his character, is that Lincoln asked these three rivals to join his cabinet, which they did--and they made it work. In a rich historical narrative, Doris Kearns Goodwin brings to life each of these figures, showing their significant individual contributions as well as how they challengedthe president and sometimes stung him. What comes across is a deep psychological portrait of Lincoln as a great conciliator and man of vision, always putting the greater good before expediency. And while much has been made of Lincoln's melancholy, it is also true that he was good in company, a born storyteller and jokester. Lincoln is perhaps the most written-about president in history, but in this group biography, Goodwin manages to find some new perspectives on Lincoln and his times. A New York Times Notable Book for the year 2005.Read full review",
            "Goodwin's Lincoln biography, Team of Rivals, shows the power of synergy.  They synthesis of diverse viewpoints always results in higher thinking and better results than unilateral thinking.  Having taught Covey's \"Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\" for many years in several organizations, I know this is true.  Plus, Obama has obviously been influenced by Lincoln's approach to building his cabinet and I wanted to read the book I know had inspired our president elect, a man I most admire!  Finally, my daughter who was an American Studies major in college, now an attorney, highly recommended it as a masterpiece of biographical writing -- it reads like a novel, telling many interwoven stories of statesmen and others during the critical time of American history.",
            "\"Team of Rivals\" is a page-turner.  It is a parallel biography of Abraham Lincoln's evolution as a politician and of the men he selected to his cabinet in his first term.  As a management study, it provides the reader with an example of executive excellence under stress.  It is a study in the ethical use of politics for the good of an organization.  Finally, it clearly shows the brilliance of our 14th president in a clear, cohesive, chronological manner.\r\n\r\nAlthough it reads like a dramatic novel, this book is among the top level of 'Lincolnography'.  It's current relevance as a \"how-to\" manual for the Obama administration makes it a 'must read' for the serious political observer as well as studens of Lincoln.",
            "This book is about President Lincoln`s political rivals who went on to be his Civil War era cabinet. All of these men worked-well during Lincoln`s tenure except Secretary of State Cameron.\r\nI believe author Doris Kearns Goodwin did a excellent job with is 800-plus page book. There are some pictures that accompany this book."

            "I purchased this book because it was referenced so many times in other materials I was reading to help myself along my journey of healing from childhood sexual abuse.  This book really helped me to think outside the box of the same old hum drum therapy procedures.  Levine helped me to understand many unique things about trauma, which I am using to find my way out of the dark.  \r\nHave you ever seen a deer with PTSD symptoms after it barely escaped being hit by your car?  How about a cow suffering from nightmares after it's leg was trapped for 8 hours in its stall?  Levine has an intriguing theory about what happens to human survivors of trauma and why we struggle with challenging after effects when our animal friends do not.  He discusses at length how the trauma effects (like the symptomsof PTSD) stay with us because we haven't been able to expel the negative energy from the trauma experience.  If we were unable to respond to the traumatic experience by either fight or flight, we most naturally froze in the face of the danger; hence, trapping that fear energy deep within our souls.  This book shares many techniques on how to release that negative energy in order to help one feel free of the PTSD and other after effects of the traumatic experience one lived through.\r\nIf you like thinking outside the box and reaching for something that connects therapeutic philosophies to our connection to the animal kingdom, then I highly recomend this book.Read full review",

            "I bought it because my therapist suggested that I read it.  I have depressive disorder, not bipolar, but I actually read it for guidance about writing professionally about a topic that one has a personal connection to.  The story is harrowing, but the writer doesn't indulge in melodrama, and every story is told in the simplest way possible.  It also manages to demonstrate that the FOX NEWS-type idea of \"objectivity\" is something of a myth, because we all bring our personal connections that drove us toward that particular area of interest.  What she does show it a that it is possible to overcome one's subjective predispositions by becoming aware of them.  She also demonstrates that mental illness is a disease like any other in that it should not make us automatically feel that their decision-making and evaluative judgments cannot be trusted; like anything else, it's a matter of degree.Read full review",

This is a work of deep intellectual and spiritual importance not only for women, but for the rare men who seek to understand women in a deeply philosophical and conceptual way.  This book occupied my nightstand for easy reference and then I foolishly loaned it never to see it again.  It has been replaced and I missed it while it wasn't here.  This is one of those books that one doesn't loan, but rather buys copies of for others.  Ms. Estes has compiled an extraordinary collection of myths about female archetypes that, when seen though her eyes, all have bearing on our lives at different times and in myriad experiences that can become road/life maps and serve as models as well.  A brilliant book by a brilliant author.Read full review",

It is my Bible,  I have been reading it for 10 years now and constantly refer to it's pages for comfort in bad times and good.  I frequently  purchase this book to give away to women everywhere.  THE author,  Clarissa Pinkola Estes is an absolute marvel at storytelling, pyschology and simply explaining why we wonder, suffer, question,  become angry,  cry...why we love, hate, rage or enjoy.  It is NOT dry text pyschology but a joyful compilation of wonderful, incredible stories about life and love.  I have not gone anywhere in the last ten years without Clarissa or without acquiring a copy of this book.  I recommend you read any work of Clarissa Pinkola ESTES in book form or on tape.",

            "Very good read. In this book, author Bessel van der Kolk, M.D. contends that many psychiatric patients are misdiagnosed, largely because those who determine the content of the DSM have chosen not to include a Developmental Trauma Disorder diagnosis. Without the clinician's option to diagnose Developmental Trauma Disorder, patients may be misdiagnosed as having ADHD, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and many other anxiety-related labels, he says. He explains that a more accurate  diagnosis could lead to more practical treatment. Citing numerous research studies, van der Kolk establishes a connection between mind and body and relates said connection to trauma at various stages of life -- from childhood abuse and neglect to war-related PTSD. Part of the joy of the read is van der Kolk's fairness in granting that some treatments such as eye movement desensitization reprocessing (EMDR) aren't yet fully understood even though they seem to be beneficial to many patients. Another part of the joy of the read is that the narratives and case studies sprinkled throughout the text keep the action flowing in a sea of statistical evidence. I'd recommend this book to clinicians, teachers, doctors, nurses, policemen, firemen, war veterans, parents, grandparents, and almost everyone else as I suspect we all either deal with our own trauma or know people who, as a result of their trauma, create chaos in others' lives. This book is enlightening and promotes hope for those who have experienced trauma.Read full review",
            "This book had fascinating illustrations of how trauma affects a person not only psychologically, but physically.  It makes you understand why some people are the way they are---anti-social personalities, people with anger management issues, etc.  It also gives some compelling evidence of unconventional therapy techniques that have shown great promise but discusses how our society seems to prefer lifelong treatment of a problem with drugs rather than treating the underlying cause and freeing a person from the burden of trauma that they carry with them throughout their lives.  The author is a psychiatrist who specializes in treating trauma patients from early childhood through adulthood.  Fascinating!",
            "I have PTSD and have been in therapy for 16 years.  This book is a must read for sufferers and help providers alike.  It is written by an extremely well qualified  research scientist with many years of treating and research.  The case studies are very interesting.  He provides information from the medical and clinical viewpoint.  The information on treatments and medications are very interesting.  As a patient I find the history of treatment and discoveries of great interest as I have seen the developments from the patient side.",
            "This is a really great book that explains how trauma damages people. The brain doesn't heal from trauma unless it's \"taught\" to (this isn't in the book, it's my own opinion after 25 years of being a therapist.\" This is a great book that's eye opening and healing for many who have experienced any form of trauma. Some reactions are trauma based and some are psychiatric. There is a difference.",
            "Finally, here is writing about the history of the PTSD diagnosis and how it came to be.  And the compassion and caring that these psychiatrists and therapists and researchers express for their patients/clients is very touching.  To me, it's as good a book as \"The Road Less Traveled\" by M. Scott Peck, MD.  Easy to read, lots of case histories that actually make sense, and are to the point, and the history of research into causation and the relationship between early childhood trauma, and how the brain adapts in order to \"function\" after it interprets the trauma.  Researchers are actually developing standards for measuring what used to be thought of as \"immeasurable\".  As an accountant and financial analyst, it's the kind of stuff I LOVE!"

            "As a parent of teenage twin boys and 20 -year teaching veteran, I first heard of this book from a high school student.  After speaking to the newly inspired reader, I borrowed the book.  The same night, I ordered two copies for home that will eventually land in my lending library.\n\nThe writing is accessible and easily understandable.  The difficult topic of how to motivate teens is effectively addressed. There is a religious message within the text, but it is not overwhelming or alienating for someone who doesn't feel as strongly or of the same faith.\n\nMy teens resisted (imagine that) reading a nonfiction book  -- at first.  Then, they started really reading the content.  Fight over.  My family of five is all reading the book; with only 2 copies, we have to share.  There is no doubt we will finish and come away stronger: alone and together.\n\nOverall, a great read for teens, parents who want to understand and motivate them, and teachers who want to educate them.Read full review",
            "As a father of 3 teenage daughters, I would HIGHLY recommend parents to purchase/borrow this book. I had heard several stories about this book and/or it's authors, so I decided to give it a try. I purposely read it during my lunch hours prior to giving it to my children, just in case. I sincerely wish there had been a book of this character when I was a preteen, mainly to have something to light a fire in my future.\nThis book lets the young people of today, and the future, know they don't have to settle for the norm, and to \"wait until you get older\" to achieve your goals. They don't have to except the \"dumbing down\" our society and education process have excepted. They can be responsible at an early age and except challenges in their lives. Most importantly, it let's them know that no matter what, God Almighty will be by their side EVERY step of the way.Read full review",
            "My 16 year-old wanted this book, so I got for her and her brothers. I read it first, so if any questions came up, I would be prepared. What I didn't expect was how it spoke to me. There is a chapter named \"Small Hard Things\" that is so needful! That was the best chapter! You can do a lot of big things, but if the little things don't get done, sooner or later there will be a price to pay.\nI really liked the book and wish every teenager from 10 to 30 (yes, I have some 30 year old \"teenaged\" relatives) could read this book, AND apply it! Churches need to have classes with this, give it to graduates, because it is an excellent resource.\nIf you have a \"teenager\", this book is an excellent choice for them!! But read it yourself first, because you will be challenged to change your life!",
            "I purchased this book after seeing a video clip from our church's youth pastor, as a promo for the conference that our youth group would be attending in Mpls. My plan had been to read the entire book before attending the conference with two of my children. After starting the book I realized that the book was so full of information that it could not be read quickly, in order to properly digest all that it contained. I have taken so much information out of each chapter so far. I meet with my kids multiple times a week to discuss that meetings reading assignment, generally one chapter every two days. I would recommend this book to everyone. Although geared to the younger generations, the principals apply to all. This book lays the challenge right our before you! If you want a challenge, readthis book and put into practice what it says! Your life can't stay the same and be unaltered if you choose to \"DO HARD THINGS!\" Our society could use more people with the attitude, determination and outlook this book promotes. A must read for ages 9 and up!Read full review",
            "I am an adult and wished I had a book like this when I was a teen. It gives real life experiences of other teens who wanted to accomplish big things but didn't know how to start. The book is easy to read and gives understanding, teaches problem solving, and encourages  teens to make the most out of their teenage years. It encouragingly, gives food for thought to all who know they have a purpose in every season of their lives, but feel stuck. This book is a testimony to what teens can do when they put their minds to it."

            "I found this book to be very thought provoking long after I finished it.  I continued to reflect on the characters and the life of the characters for months.  I talked about the book and passed it on to many other people.  I even shared a passage at group study that had nothing to do with books or heaven.  That's what makes it such an excellent book for me, the fact that it applied to many different areas of life.  This book has something to say about a person's life and the title is misleading to those who think it is all about or just about Heaven and/or God. I found it to be easy to read, though some elements were almost too simplistic.  Having read Mitch Albom's \"Tuesdays With Morrie\" first, I was somewhat disappointed by this simplicity.  I think the story theme could have stayed simple, as is Albom's writing style, but still used a bit more detailed written word.  In this book, I think Albom needed to do this because the story really exercises the reader's mind.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read something that does more than just entertain, but will also challenge them in some way.Read full review",

            "This short fiction is amazing only in that is has sold as well as it has and that many people actually like it. Human nature draws us to find a description of Heaven. M. Albom's title gives the illusion that one might find a realistic, perhaps verifiable account of what Heaven will be like. Albom is so far off from the truth that any real believer of Heaven and hell would toss this novel on the floor in disgust as I did. A seasoned writer could spit a book out like this in less than a week; \"The 5 People You Meet in Heaven,\" is elementary reading level, void of all substantiation, and even depressing if Albom's opinion is considered accurate. I wouldn't take a copy of this novel for free. I couldn't even sell it at a yard sell in good faith; I threw my copy inthe trash. I couldn't pass on such sacrilege written with no compelling hints of truth that would inspire a person to seek further.Read full review",
            "I found this book quite confusing and didn't get the message the author was trying to get across.My mother gave me this book she loved and gave me a copy to read.She also said I can keep the book. Three months later my mother passed away suddenly or maybe she  didn't she not tell us she was very sick to protect her children  one final time. I learned later that she gave all her children four including me the same little red book about the same time.\r\n     I knew I would read this book with a new perspective especially in the early mourning stage, I was missing her much more than I ever imagine.I  re=read the book which is rather short, and as I cried and tears stained the pages I knew that my mother would be one of the 5 people I will meet in heaven because she was  always therefor us in heaven.\r\n  The book has a very direct message . What we do and how we live our lives is our choice, life is short and \"live each day like it is your last\"  you never know when that day will be like the main character Eddie a simple older man,   who  knew all he would ever be is a man fixing rides in a run down amusement park which is dull and meaningless it seems Eddie is a inspiration to all mankind because he is  dedicated to this job and  concerned about the safety of all the ride running safely.Ironically, he dies trying to save a life of a little girl who falls out of a defective ride.Death a total surprise  was a result of another person not properly doing his job and a ride broke apart iro making sure it was running properly, ironically Eddie died doing the job he loved .\r\nI started to think of anything I did in my past that possibly caused another's death,For every action there is a reaction. Every life is meaningfull and Eddie is a inspirational charactor in this story. We are all equal in the the end no mattter how much money or material things we acquired in life. How we lived our live and how we treated others is the only important things we take with us after we leave this world. Eddie also learns that while we are alive we must resolve personal grudges and let anger go before its to late especially with loved ones. Eddie still has ro face this issue with his father. The point validify love and work out problems with loved ones while you are both alive, death may not give you a chance to finish personal business and that is final we  don't get another chance. \r\n  The book is rather short , I read it in about 2 hours, a great beach book!\r\n It is great for those who like Sylvia Brown and John Edward's books, like their books this little red book opened up a new way of looking at the world and although my mother is gone she gave us hope giving us this book that maybe one dsy we will meet in heaven.\r\n  This book is timeless original Book reminds us one day will die and death may come very when you least expect it.The writing is excellent  original and tells a very inspirational story . I read it months ago and I still think about this book almost daily. It has helped me to get out of bed snd to start to living again> My mother is gone but not forgotten,She would sayz\"this too shall pass\" meaning get on with your life.\r\n   This book is to  be a  bew classic for generations to come. Read this book!!!Read full review",
            "Doubtless, this was one of the most touching and emotional books I have ever read.  It was recommended to me by an elderly minister in Abilene, Texas.  When I first picked it up and started to read, I hated the beginning ... I wanted to put it down ... but I kept on reading.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that made the book so endearing to me, and which kept me reading, was the introduction of each new and totally intriguing person that would take the main character of the story back into and through another segment of his life already lived.  Meeting them is quite an adventure.\r\n\r\nMitch Albom's gift at description is marvelous; the reader can practically see what is happening every step of the way.  And yet there was simply no way to anticipate where this uncanny journey backwards in time would lead the main character, or how it would so delightfully carry him to the end of the journey, his quest for understanding and answers.\r\n\r\nThere is a mathematical oddity we identify as \"the six degrees of separation.\"  That came to mind throughout this book.  In life, we may never discover the way in which a decision we made, or an action we took, impacts another -- someone we might not have ever met.  This book causes one to consider that and step more carefully.  Life is fragile.  And temporary.  The storytelling is remarkable, so perfect, so applicable, so thrilling.  There is great satisfaction in reading this book and enjoying the beautiful tie that binds it all together.Read full review"

            "I finished reading the book in short order.  This may be because I already saw the movie version.  The book and movie  plots are  the same.  However, the movie adaptation of the story is a little bit different.  The book has some additional characters and situations.  I liked the movie so much, I couldn't wait to read the book.  I would have to rate the movie higher than the book version.  This may be due to the excellent performance of the actors.  Also, I liked the ending in the movie better than the book ending.  The movie version gives the viewers the sights, sounds and scenery of the years it all took place.   The facial expressions of the actors, and the tone of their voice can not be duplicated in the book.  The movie is rated PG 13  This is an appropriate rating for this movie version.  If the movie contained foul language and nudity it would have been rated R.   Thankfully, the movie version does not contain this content.  Reading the book will allow the reader compare each version of the story.Read full review",

By engaging the rational part of my brain while experiencing strong emotions, just the act of trying to engage my thinking that way, it lessens the intensity of the emotion. It's amazing!",

            "Definitely more than just an instruction manual for drawing. It focuses more on developing the perceptive and mental abilities used by artists to draw what they see. Some books have exercises that improve your abilities by simple repetition and rote and while you certainly won't get any better at drawing (or any other activity) without tons of practice, the exercises in this book are more unique and heavily focused on teaching you how to see like an artist and how to transfer those abilities to paper. I feel like some of the conclusions the author makes about neuroscience and how it relates to drawing are a little dated and stretching, but the basic science is there. I recommend getting the exercise workbook that goes along with the title but there are plenty of actual exercises in the text alone.\n\nIf you read this book, follow the instructions and do the exercises, unless you are already a Da Vinci, your drawing abilities WILL improve.Read full review",
            "Very simply, this is a book that anyone and everyone should purchase if they have any interest in learning to draw portraits.  Ms. Edwards has proven that everyone possesses the ability to draw realistically.  Pick up a copy of this book and look and the before and after drawings.  If that doesn't convince you that you too have the untrained ability to create awesome drawings...\n\nGive Ms. Edwards' ideas a try.  You will shortly realize the \"truth\" of her position as you work her fun-to-do exercises.  Even it the assignments were not fun, the rapid progression of your drawing skills would make them well worthwhile.  Obviously this book is not a artistic \"magic bullet\" but you will learn to draw with a realism that is almost photographic.  Forget your preconceived notions about your drawingskill.  I promise you a very happy surprise; you can draw.\n\n\nPlease spare two seconds to click the YES link at the end of this page if you find this review interesting, useful, or informative.

Your left brain is a \"know-it-all\" but doesn't really \"see\".  The right brain is what you need to really discover what's there.  This book will get you there.

            "In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell offers his account of humanity's seemingly instantaneous judgment in critical situations.  The book features a series of fascinating anecdotal case studies, skilled interweavings of psychological experiments, explanations, and unexpected connections which have become part of Gladwell's writing style since Tipping Point.\n\nAt the outset of Blink, he illustrates how incredibly complex decisions are often made in the matter of seconds: experts on Greek art, who had no vested interest in judging a rare 6th-century sculpture of a youth as authentic, sensed immediately that it was fake.  But Gladwell points out that if expertise, or mere accumulated experiences sufficed, humans could unerringly trust these decisions made as rapidly as the blink of an eye, but, as he illustrates through several counterpuntal stories, such blinks can also be deceptive.   It should be noted that he seems to stretch some of his examples to conform to his blink-of-an-eye theory.\n\nGladwell is an impressive synthesizer and is, in that sense, a model for both teachers and students.  Because of his skills as a journalist, the book is accurate and informative -- complete with numerous anecdotes.  Blink is a satisfying and informative read, but not as scholarly as some might have you believe.Read full review",
            "Some great 'aha' moments and quick read. Gladwell uses great examples and a lot of back up data including websites to confirm his thesis. Decisions due to your first few seconds to the pitfalls of when your intuition can be blind sighted.\nKey to the thoughts for me was the relevance of listening to your gut and acting on your impressions does have value and is based in man's DNA for survival. Often second guessing ourselves or over analyzing issues leads to inaction and acceptance. Recognizing what can harm you or a 'toxic' boss or relationship sooner than rationalizing 'bad for you behaviors' is epic to survive in the corporate world rift with undermining basic instincts that can lead to greater success.\nI have attended top level executive meetings for two major US Comapnies where Gladwell spent two hours a week in ignoring gut needs and expounding on over analyzing to the point of inaction and worse continue the game with their staff so all are spinning wheels to no avail. Those companies are not successful.\nCorporate America should make this book a read for any executives struggling with today's economy to get back to the first impression and swift action to market or acknowlege sooner to trust the front line employees more that are hands on doing the work that is no longer creating progress for the very company that puts food on their table.\nI have seen the last five years of my current company unable to decide about who should be the CIO (five in five years)not to mention to CEO's.\nI don't feel crazy anymore for thinking how idiotic over thinking Executives plan their strategies for their goal only to wordsmith it to the point of indecision once again then fire that Executive team and bring in a new group only to have them repeat the same mistakes allover again without the expertise and gut interpretaions of employees that can give the new team the insight that what they are proposing already failed in the past.\nSo I recommend this read for all Executives and embrace it with open minds and then pass the book down through the ranks and empower their employees to help with their first take and move the companies forward.Read full review",
            "I love Malcolm Gladwell's style of writing, some parts you can skim over and still get the jist of the point, but the power of our unconscious thinking in rapid cognition decision-making is brought forward by Gladwell throughout the book by various easy to relate to examples. I find myself constantly trying to bring my unconscious mind into combination with my conscious mind by thinking of ways to thin-slice decisions on expert intuition instead of loading my conscious down with such an overly abundant amount of information that I lose sight of what I was trying to accomplish in the first place. Nice, easy read. Thumbs up!!",
            "I love Malcolm Gladwell books.  His writing style combines a unique and great mixture of down-to-earth explanations of heady themes with easy to understand words and explanations.  Books like his (including the previous release \"Tipping Point\") really help average readers who aren't intellectuals understand some pretty intense and 'hard to wrap your head around' psychological, statistical and historical trends that just happen to affect almost all of us at some time or another in our lives.  This material is a fascinating and quick read and you'll find that it is filled with so many facts that you'll be telling your co-workers, friends and family about so many different and interesting things that you've learned by reading it.  I highly recommend this book."

The author (Daniel Amen) demonstrates how all the proper parenting in the world will not solve a brain disorder and gives ideas for other methods (nutritional, educational, emotional, and prescriptive) to enhance moods and behaviors. My attitude towards many of the people I know has changed and softened because of this book. \r\n\r\nIf you read it, also check out some of the web sites that promote Mr. Amen's ideas further and be sure to note that over the several years that this book has been available, more therapy based on these ideasis available.Read full review"

            "Several years ago, I was going through a lot with family and work. One of my co-workers gave me this book as a present. It really helped me! There is so much great advice given in this book. A few years ago, my best friend showed up on my door step, because her husband and she had a really bad fight. Of course, I told her my house is her house, and she could stay as long as she needed to. A few days later, I was cleaning and came across my book given to me by my co-worker. I gave it to my dear friend and told her how much it helped me. The next day when I came home from work, she told me how much she enjoyed reading this book. She said it really opened her eyes and her mind. It wasn't long after that her and her husband were back together. Now, I'm not saying this is the answer to all of the problems people have, but it does give you a better perspective as how to handle things. Since then, I have bought a few more copies of this book, and gave them as presents to my friends.Read full review",
            "The mini-chapters (1-3 pages) make it easy to get the author's point and to see how t make almost immediate application of the concepts to life.  The book seems to follow this theme:  Minimize your self-misguided anxiety and maximize your joy of living.  The book is short enough to refer back to frequently for a refresher course on how to live a more peaceful life.  \r\n\r\nI decided to buy my own copy after reading through some of the chapeters while waiting in a doctor's office lobby.",
            "i've had this book before, so I remembered it. I like this book. it's a good read. I really do agree with this title of this book. my ex-husband & my current boyfriend are the type of men that \"Constantly\" Sweat the Small Stuff, when there really is NO Need to do so. It frustrates me to great lengths. I keep my mouth shut, cus showing them how much they frustrate me, doesn't help matters either. Thank God my ex-husband has been completely out of my life since November 29th, 2000. but my Current Bf..well....I Love Him, but he's driving me Crazy. I'm Hoping that this book will help him to see the error of his ways before it's too late. Life is Way Too Short to sweat the small stuff. People. just Let it Go, Let it All Go. You'll be much Happier& Stress Free if you would just Stop sweating the small stuff.Read full review",

There are situations where everyone reads and goes....I've been in that spot.  Its very good advice on how to learn what to do and think in stressful situations.  A family member wanted to read my copy and I bought them their own copy because I believe its a good book to keep for reference.  Every now and then I go back and refresh my memory of the lessons.",
            "I recommend this book for everyone.\nWhile it seems like dealing with daily struggles just takes a common sense approach, this book really helps you keep these issues in perspective and offers innovative steps to keep anger and stress in check."

            "Very good read. In this book, author Bessel van der Kolk, M.D. contends that many psychiatric patients are misdiagnosed, largely because those who determine the content of the DSM have chosen not to include a Developmental Trauma Disorder diagnosis. Without the clinician's option to diagnose Developmental Trauma Disorder, patients may be misdiagnosed as having ADHD, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and many other anxiety-related labels, he says. He explains that a more accurate  diagnosis could lead to more practical treatment. Citing numerous research studies, van der Kolk establishes a connection between mind and body and relates said connection to trauma at various stages of life -- from childhood abuse and neglect to war-related PTSD. Part of the joy of the read is van der Kolk's fairness in granting that some treatments such as eye movement desensitization reprocessing (EMDR) aren't yet fully understood even though they seem to be beneficial to many patients. Another part of the joy of the read is that the narratives and case studies sprinkled throughout the text keep the action flowing in a sea of statistical evidence. I'd recommend this book to clinicians, teachers, doctors, nurses, policemen, firemen, war veterans, parents, grandparents, and almost everyone else as I suspect we all either deal with our own trauma or know people who, as a result of their trauma, create chaos in others' lives. This book is enlightening and promotes hope for those who have experienced trauma.Read full review",
            "This book had fascinating illustrations of how trauma affects a person not only psychologically, but physically.  It makes you understand why some people are the way they are---anti-social personalities, people with anger management issues, etc.  It also gives some compelling evidence of unconventional therapy techniques that have shown great promise but discusses how our society seems to prefer lifelong treatment of a problem with drugs rather than treating the underlying cause and freeing a person from the burden of trauma that they carry with them throughout their lives.  The author is a psychiatrist who specializes in treating trauma patients from early childhood through adulthood.  Fascinating!",
            "I have PTSD and have been in therapy for 16 years.  This book is a must read for sufferers and help providers alike.  It is written by an extremely well qualified  research scientist with many years of treating and research.  The case studies are very interesting.  He provides information from the medical and clinical viewpoint.  The information on treatments and medications are very interesting.  As a patient I find the history of treatment and discoveries of great interest as I have seen the developments from the patient side.",
            "This is a really great book that explains how trauma damages people. The brain doesn't heal from trauma unless it's \"taught\" to (this isn't in the book, it's my own opinion after 25 years of being a therapist.\" This is a great book that's eye opening and healing for many who have experienced any form of trauma. Some reactions are trauma based and some are psychiatric. There is a difference.",
            "Finally, here is writing about the history of the PTSD diagnosis and how it came to be.  And the compassion and caring that these psychiatrists and therapists and researchers express for their patients/clients is very touching.  To me, it's as good a book as \"The Road Less Traveled\" by M. Scott Peck, MD.  Easy to read, lots of case histories that actually make sense, and are to the point, and the history of research into causation and the relationship between early childhood trauma, and how the brain adapts in order to \"function\" after it interprets the trauma.  Researchers are actually developing standards for measuring what used to be thought of as \"immeasurable\".  As an accountant and financial analyst, it's the kind of stuff I LOVE!"

            "This book was a disappointment.  It basically stated the obvious, that certain factors \"tip\" people one way or another- context, persuasion, genetics, etc., and produce trends as well as personal preferences.  There wasn't anything in here that was not common sense.\n\nFor example, the chapter on why teenagers still start smoking even after decades of health warnings, etc., provided no new insight.  Basically, the reason provided was that kids don't start smoking because the action of smoking  is cool; they start smoking because the SMOKERS are cool.  In other words, cool people smoke, just like they do other things.  So to be cool, you'll emulate the cool people.  And smoking is one thing you can do to be like them.\n\nAlso, the author states that genetics is the reason why certain smokers become addicted (every-day smoking of several cigarettes per day, with great difficulty in quitting including withdrawal symptoms) and why other people can smoke very few cigarettes in a week, every week, for example, and easily stop doing that with no problem.  Since the concept of \"social smokers\" is quite well known now, I don't think this was any revelation.  Just like not every social drinker becomes an alcoholic, not every social smoker becomes a hard-core nicotine fiend.  And doesn't genetics cause pretty much everything? I've heard a figure of 80% of our behavior, traits, intelligence, etc. is genetic.  This may or may not be true, but the proposition that nature, rather than nurture, is controlling us is not a new idea either.  The \"masses\" won't be impressed with his ideas on genes.\n\nThis book was also very short.  I would have appreciated much more substance, and just more MATERIAL in general.  Thankfully I got this from the library so I didn't waste my money on a short, dissatisfying book that states the obvious and expects the public to be wowed by the \"insight.\"\n\nThe author seems to have rattled off this book in one sitting, perhaps as an afterthought, for what reason, I don't know.   I also sensed a patronizing tone throughout.  I get the impression by reading it that he wrote this first as an outline for some high school sociology class, and then tried to expand it to something that the great \"unwashed masses\" would take as a serious, scholarly work.  Well, I'm sure that even the \"masses\" aren't that easily impressed.\n\nSo I do not recommend wasting your time on this one!Read full review",
            "Malcolm Gladwell's Tipping Point considers the elements needed to make a particular movement gain mass appeal.  The title concept, \"tipping point,\" occurs when something that began small- a few funky kids in New York's East Village wearing Hush Puppies- turns into something very large- millions of Hush\nPuppies are sold.  According to the author, the success of advancing any idea depends on three rules: the Law of the Few, the Stickiness Factor, and the Power of Context.\n\nGladwell offers a theory of social dynamics that he contends will provoke a mass behavioral change.  He offers numerous anecdotes to make his point: Paul Revere's ride, the creation of the children's TV program Sesame Street, and the influence of subway shooter Bernie Goetz.  After analyzing a number of fascinating psychological studies, he propses that tipping points occur when subtle alterations in the environment, such as the eradication of graffiti, are enacted by a small number of people who act as connectors, mavens, and salesmen.  As he applies his strikingly counter-intuitive hypotheses to everything from the \"stickiness,\" or popularity, of certain children's television programs to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, Gladwell reveals that our cherished belief in the autonomy of the self is based, in\ngreat part, on wishful thinking.\n\nTipping Point has the feel of a cut-and-paste narrative- which is probably attributable to Gladwell's journalistic background- and is definitely not the stuff of deep academic research, or sociological thought.  It is, however, an entertaining read that I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND and should affirm what we already knew, if we were honest with ourselves.Read full review",
            "Have read all three of Malcolm Gladwell's books.  Each title has a totally surprising approach to what causes things in life to change.  I found that the content of this book dealt with how things in life can change. After extended changes occur an unexpected crescendo may cause a tipping point that may make directional changes necessary.  Often we can see it coming but may be surprised just how little influence we have to the tipping point. Lots of fun and a quick read.  Good trip on the plane.",
            "This is an important book to read if you want to know how crazy the buyers can be and how a person needs to be tuned into the unpredictable factors that can push your product or idea to the forefront and cause it to spread virally.  It helps me realize that I must always prepare for the best possible outcome with any of my projects even if they start slowyly--to always being getting the ideas in front of people so that the \"right\" person doesn't miss the chance to help you share BIG with the world.\nThis book lends another perspective for anyone wanting to have a well-rounded foundation in what's happening and what can happen in the whimsical global market.",
            "This is an excellent example of in-depth journalism.  Some books are fast food: fun to read, but not really nourishing.  Some are like those horse pill multi-vitamins:  spilling over with everything your body needs, but really hard to swallow.  This book is one of the best literary meals I have had in quite awhile!  It is delicious!  It is easy to read, very insightful, loaded with information, and thought provoking.  For me, it is the kind of book that I could read pleasurably over a few weeks time.  I didn't need to inhale it.  I wanted to assimilate the commentary slowly.  I enjoyed it so much that I bought a copy for one of my sisters for her birthday.  I will enjoy discussing it with her as she nibbles her way through it.\n\nIf you love to read and you're interested in the elements of events that cause them to tip one way or another, you'll find this book fascinating.  The author is an excellent writer.  If you've ever read his blogs or his work for the New Yorker then you probably appreciate his style.  I'd also recommend BLINK, his subsequent work.  I look forward to more books from this young, talented author.Read full review"

It's been really great so far and we have all grown from doing this. While I don't agree with all the concepts in this book (for example, I don't believe that seeing our parents in their underwear is sexual abuse, or that without boundaries people will DIE - Mellody is pretty severe in her judgments in my opinion) some of the readings have been really eye opening.\n\nDon't read this book if you are not currently seeing a therapist regularly and without discussing it first with your therapist.

Dean Koontz is known for his books on human existence; love, hope and good against evil. This one is somewhat different from his others in that you know something bad is going to happen to the main character, Jimmy Tock, on 5 named days in his future. His grandfather made these predictions on his deathbed and as the novel progress you see that the predictions are coming true. There are several unexpected twists throughout the plot. It is both suspenseful and funny. I haven't read a book by Dean Koontz that I did not like.",

The author has advanced degrees in both medicine and psychology. He obviously knows his stuff. But what was surprising to me is that the experiences in his life he shares, along with his intellectual and spiritual revalations are to say the least - enlightened. The spiritual connotation in the book is non-denominational. While Dr. Hawkins came from a Christian background, his understanding of God has transcended the four walls of the church itself.

The message Dr. Hawkins has is so important to spiritual growth and understanding.  His use of kinesiology is amazing.

It's my understanding that he's giving his last seminar this year, and there may not be any more \"Hawkins Books.\"  My advice, if you are on a spiritual journey, is to read all you can by him - especially this book, The Eye of the I, Truth vs Falsehood, and Transcending the Levels of Consiousness.

I highly recommend it.",
            "I bought this book because I occasionally work with victims of domestic abuse, and this book was regularly recommended by the local Safe House staff.  It is an eye opening book with disturbing but valuable insight.  The author uses numerous real life stories to demonstrate that our instincts regularly give us accurate warning when we are around dangerous people, and that we ignore our instincts at our peril. I'd like my daughter to read this book before she goes off to college.",

            "Most instructors make a syllabus available at least 3 weeks before a semester starts. For whatever reason my instructor uploaded the wrong syllabus, the first day of class we spent more time re-writing her corrections. It was at that time that the whole class discovered that we had a quiz on 2 chapters in 1 week (even the ISBN # was wrong). Needless to say, I know I was not the only feeling pressure when we left class. \n\n\n    My instructor suggested this book, I came home and found this GREAT DEAL and a delivery date that fit my needs, with a day or so left over to have sometime off after writing a 10pg book report on it, according to the delivery options. Well, beyond my expectations, the book arrived today !!!! Not only is this a surprise, it is a relief and I get an additional fewdays off, for a total of 5 days.

It is all interesting but the story is what I was mostly interested in to share with another person who has had several times her cheese has been moved.  I hope she will get the point of the book.\n\n\nThe cover is drab, the pictures are too even though they are the correct pictures\n\nPresentation is what begins the sell of many  things.

            "I had heard a lot about this book. Never ever got to read it. Recently I got hold of one copy from HR in our company. I read it on a plane journey. The concept is pretty simple but what is important is author has tried to spell it out in a very interesting fashion. Author uses mice respresenting simple straight thinking and mice like people representing complex thinking. Author's idea of 'Keeping things simple in order to make our lives much comfortable' is so very true. Beginning of the book is nice and intriguing. I wouldn't be surprised if the reader gets bored in the middle of the book. Some times author is trying to emphasize a point over and over again. This can be really boring for some people. Nevertheless the objective of empasis seems to be justified as you reach the end of the book. Overall it was interesting light reading with some inspiration and new outlook towards looking at things in life. Its a really small book, if you like reading somethign light, its worth reading once. I surely say that the central idea may or may not apply for individual's situation.Read full review",
            "The books start with a group of friend meeting up after their high school reunion, and on of the friends start telling a story, Who moved my cheese??? It is a story about two little mise and two little man looking for a cheese in a maze .The cheese in the story is a symbol for everything we treasure in life ... The cheese can be our job,our relationship,or everything else thats important to us ,When the cheese in the book runs out each and every character deals differently with the situation ,\nAs you continue reading the book you will find yourself relating to the character and notice the way you react to the changes that occurs in your life The fear of unknown, the fear of failed and how we let fear control our life, and that sometime we rather stay in our comfort zone instead of dealingwith the changes.\n\nThis book is about how we adapt the changes in our life.\nand how we can create new possibilities when the change accurs.\nWho moved my cheese??is a great book for dealing with everyday changes.\nThe story teach us how to imburse the change ,and it how to let go of old ideas and habits and embracing new ones.Read full review",
            "This parable featuring two mice named Sniff and Scurry and two people named Hem and Haw attempts to address the subject of change and characterize the pros and cons of different approaches to change.  Sound simple ?  It is.  This could be a kid\u2019s book written in 15 point font and still not make 15 pages.  How and why the author managed to generate enough verbiage to fill an entire book, let alone make a fortune as a bestseller, is beyond me.  Seriously, this is kindergarten 101 stuff.  Things change.  You can react or not react.  You can react slowly or quickly.  You can be flexible or inflexible.  You can embrace change or fear and avoid change.  Are you bored reading this review ?  Think how bored you will be reading the book.\r\n\r\nWhy would you ever buy this book ?  There are plane ridesthat are too short to get really drunk on.  There are conversations with your mother-in-law that could potentially be avoided.  Maybe youre actually dealing with a major change in your life, aren\u2019t sure how to deal with it, and need a framework to think about your options.  These are all good reasons to buy the book and given the money ($5) and time (1h 25m) you\u2019ll need to invest to read the book, it seems like a small price to pay.  My big take away from this book is that I need to change professions and become a self-help writer recycling childhood life lessons in the form of parables that sit in the business section of the bookstore.Read full review"

He could have left out the chapters on exorcism and it would be in my top 10 of all time. Not because of the conclusions he offers concerning the exorcisms, but because of his ideas about who should be present in future exorcisms. \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14",
            "A very readable book.  The author cuts through textbook psychological disorders and gets to the underlying root of the most painful human conditions.  Peck is an MD who gives power to his assessment of human evil.  Don't let the aspect of religion deter you from reading this book.  It is medically based.  If the Christianity piece of it bothers you, skip the 1st chapter and perhaps the ending chapters on exhorcism.  What's in between is solid psychiatric writing that addresses mental health issues from a new point of view.  This reader found the arguement compelling, the reading fluid and the case studies interesting.  Not a heavy read, but a meaty concept.",
            "This is an interesting book explaining a perspective on what is wrong about certain aspects of human society and the inability or refusal of some people to take accountability for their actions.  The author at times comes across as a holier than thou \"Psychiatrist\" expert, but he highlights his experience with individuals who are intent on hiding their actions and blaming the world for their problems.  As a therapist who has worked with such individuals I believe Dr. Peck has some correct ideas about what is wrong with aspects of society that perpetuate the escaping of individual responsibility and personal accountability.  This book is an interesting read.",

The book addresses some of the psychology behind being creatively \"stuck,\" why we avoid using our creative talents, and why creativity should be a priority. The exercises are useful and relevant. I particularly enjoyed the discussion of cleaning out the house--metaphorically and literally ridding ourselves of those things we no longer need.\n\nIf you have a hard time interpreting the word \"God\" to suit your personal belief system, you might have difficulty with this book.  While the book is not doctrine specific, many discussions do focus on the spirituality of creativity.\n\nI bought this book after I joined a meet-up group designed to go through the various chapters and discuss how the material might be relevant to our personal creative lives.  It's been an excellent source of discussion for those of us interested in creative process.Read full review",
            "I like the spiritual journey into letting your creative artistry flow. I like how the book is setup with comprehensive lessons, tasks, and check ins at the end of each chapter. The author shares very interesting and comprehensive ways to exploring our creative energies.",
            "I was enthusiastic about this book during my first reading of it; some of the concepts presented in the book really resonated with me. The author recommends daily journaling, which is something I do anyway. Also, the idea of \u201cartists dates\u201d appealed to me. \r\n\r\nUpon re-reading the book I have changed my favorable opinion of it. I now realize that there are many harmful things that I initially overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that I think is harmful: It seems to me that Cameron advises artists to pretty much squash their \u201cinner critic\u201d flat. While this might be a good idea for an artist who is so blocked that (s)he can\u2019t produce any work at all, I think it is dangerous advice for a working artist who is already successfully creating. Personally, I know that the drive to satisfy my \u201cinner critic\u201d is part of what makes my art good.  My inner critic is a real slave-driver, and she has high standards. As tempting as it would be to just make her go away, that would have a negative effect in the outcome of the quality of my art. In the long run I think it is more productive to learn to nurture your inner critic and satisfy her demands than it is to trample her.\r\n\r\nAnother harmful thing about \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Way\u201d: My impression after reading this book is that the author presumes to speak for God, and that she presents her own opinions as facts in this area. She seems to be of the opinion that spirituality and creativity are inextricably linked. I disagree, considering that I know some highly creative atheists who are successful artists. Many of the premises in this book are just plain flawed.\r\n\r\nThis book is as much about religious indoctrination as it is about creativity. I know people who have mistaken this book for a Christian book because of all the references to God that are made in it. It is definitely NOT a Christian book. It is a new age book. I would not recommend this book to anyone who doesn\u2019t already embrace a new-age viewpoint. There are many things about the religious concepts in this book that you might find disagreeable if you don't agree with New Age philosophy. I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend it to Christians, nor would I recommend it to atheists or agnostics. (Truthfully I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone.) If you do read the book, please stay alert to the places in which the author presents her religious beliefs and opinions as fact.\r\n\r\nThis book has an eerie amount in common with the 12-step programs popularized by Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. There are exactly 12 chapters in this book; each of them incorporates the concept of \u201cRecovery\u201d in some way:\r\n\r\nWeek 1: Recovering a Sense of Safety \r\nWeek 2: Recovering a Sense of Identity \r\nWeek 3: Recovering a Sense of Power \r\nWeek 4: Recovering a Sense of Integrity \r\nWeek 5: Recovering a Sense of Possibility \r\nWeek 6: Recovering a Sense of Abundance \r\nWeek 7: Recovering a Sense of Connection \r\nWeek 8: Recovering a Sense of Strength \r\nWeek 9: Recovering a Sense of Compassion \r\nWeek 10: Recovering a Sense of Self-Protection \r\nWeek 11: Recovering a Sense of Autonomy \r\nWeek 12: Recovering a Sense of Faith \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t need to recover any of these things. I think it\u2019s presumptuous of the author to assume we\u2019ve all lost our senses of compassion, integrity, strength, faith(etc.)\r\n\r\nIn all fairness, the book is interesting to read & some of the exercises in it are quite creative. Overall, though, I think that this book is a waste of time.Read full review",
            "If you have hit a wall with a creative project - or life in general - try this book. Even if you don't do every single exercise every day, it will make you think about your process and I've noticed that ideas and memories surface unannounced. You don't need to be a deity-believer - just take what works for you and ignore the rest. Interestingly, I'm finding that I'm a lot less smirky under my mask about the god-references in the book. The phrase \"random universe\" works well as a replacement if you need one. If you can do it with someone else I'd recommend it. Much like 12-step programs, doing it with another person keeps you committed."
